# ADR 10: Electron Forge to build and publish the app

## Status

accepted

## Context

We need a reliable way to build our electron app and publish it for everyone. There should be app images for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Decision

We initially used Electron Buidler and that worked fine. Electron Builder has been around for quite some time and it matured well enough to be used in the biggest projects. But recently Electron Forge has released a new version and their way of using Electron's built-in features instead of rewriting them like Electron Builder means that they will get instant updates as Electron itself evolves. This is kind of futureproofing for us.

## Consequences

That means that we should rewrite our configuration to be compatible with Electron Forge. While that should be straightforward enough, Electron Forge doesn't play nicely with monorepoes. So That will be a bit more complicated to integrate. It is however easier to invest that time now rather than later, while we can easily pivot.  
This decision was taken starting 1.0.0-alpha (The first public release).
