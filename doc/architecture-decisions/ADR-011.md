# ADR 11: Axios for calls to the Jira API

## Status

accepted

## Context

We want to be able to configure the headers, base URL and other parameters once for Jira API calls, instead of each time we make a call as previous with the `fetch` and `cross-fetch` packages.

## Decision

We are now using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), a package that enables creation of REST clients and enables us to configure defaults for each call.
Additionally, we are able to define error handlers for specific HTTP error calls, enabling default error handling for e.g. 401 responses.

## Consequences

Every call to the Jira Server API (except for authorization calls to e.g. fetch a token) should be made via an Axios instance.
This also means rewriting the error handling in each call, finding common errors and enabling default handling for them.
